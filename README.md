# FortPatcher-NX


Play old (and new versions if banned) of Fortnite on the Nintendo Switch!

I'm not responsible of any console bans or Fortnite account bans caused by these patches.

For more info you can join this discord server: https://discord.gg/vut68szyHC

### Downloads

You can download the latest patches on the latest release! There's also an `all_patches.zip` file in the release if you don't want to download all patches manually.
You can then drag all the ips patches in a folder with a name of your liking in `atmosphere/exefs_patches/`

### Disclaimer

This is uncompiled so it won't work as is on Switch! Compile the patches with [IPSwitch](https://github.com/3096/ipswitch)!

### How to compile the patches
1. First of all, download ipswitch which is linked above.
2. Put the .nro in the sd card and switch folder like this: SD/switch/IPSWITCH
3. Now make a folder inside the IPSWITCH folder and name it FortPatcherNX
4. Then put all the pchtxt (or just the one version you want) files inside that folder
5. Boot Homebrew Launcher and launch IPSWITCH.
6. (TODO i dont have a switch so i cant finish this atm)
